# [Fâ€™ Math Component Tutorial](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/Tutorials/MathComponent/Tutorial.html)

Get an error at [4.5.1. Set Up the Unit Test Environment](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/Tutorials/MathComponent/Tutorial.html#The-MathSender-Component_Write-and-Run-Unit-Tests_Set-Up-the-Unit-Test-Environment):

In discussion [here](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/discussions/1135#discussioncomment-2133443) pointed at [Fix Section 4.5.1 of Math Component Tutorial](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/pull/1243) ; had to look at the commit w/ the updated md, inlcuding finding related issue [fprime-util impl --ut command not generating Tester.cpp and Tester.hpp in Ref/MathSender](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/issues/1238) which included a note about removeing some files [here](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/issues/1238#issuecomment-1025790962). 
Finally ran into [Fatal error with fprime-util build --ut](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/issues/1258); wasn't obvious to me that the write up was to open Tester.hpp and change two instances of MathSenderComponentImpl to MathSender (had to go look at a related GitHub account [here](https://github.com/capsulecorplab/fprime/commit/5a815b4d6766edf7db385354688149462790c87d))


I find myself wanting a checklist / process flow diagram / overview. I am worried that after running the tutorials, I'll have to go back to the tutorials to remember the steps in order. Maybe the current checklist / flow diagram / overview can be expanded in the tutorials, with thinks like "fill in stubs" demoed?


Error at [5.2. Add the Model to the Project](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/Tutorials/MathComponent/Tutorial.html#The-MathReceiver-Component_Add-the-Model-to-the-Project). When trying to re-run [4.3. Build the Stub Implementation](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/Tutorials/MathComponent/Tutorial.html#The-MathSender-Component_Build-the-Stub-Implementation) got an error with `fprime-util impl` had to go up to /Ref/ and run `fprime-util generate` and then `fprime-util build` in /Ref, then cd back into MathReceiver to get `fprime-util impl` to work.

Error at [6.2. Updating the Topology](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/Tutorials/MathComponent/Tutorial.html#Updating-the-Ref-Deployment_Updating-the-Topology); first ran into this error:
```
~/02_Projects/fprime/Ref/Top$ fprime-util fpp-check -u unconnected.txt

Which looked like part of [fpp-check Resulting in Error Message #1255](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/issues/1255) ; per LeStarch suggestion, added `Ref/build-fprime-automatic-native/fpp-tools-install/` to $PATH. 

# Cross Compile Testing; Porting Math Demo to RPi
Started with the "Cross Compiling for the Raspberry PI" section of [F Fprime GPS demo instructions](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/Tutorials/GpsTutorial/Tutorial.html) but intent is to just cross compile the Math Component to the RPi first.

Tested the Math Component (per above) on WSL2 linux "native" first, then edited to cross compile.

## Setup RPi4
Usual sudo apt-get update & upgrade
Followed RPi directions [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/remote-access.html) to setup SSH from host to RPi
Confirmed SSH ability from host to RPi4
Checked RPi version:
```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ uname -m
armv7l
```
so using 32 bit OS. Version info:
```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Raspbian
Description:    Raspbian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)
Release:        10
Codename:       buster
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ hostnamectl
   Static hostname: raspberrypi
         Icon name: computer
        Machine ID: b2ecfd255d374c23bf12149870d6520a
           Boot ID: 28be2f14f1974e218ebf32ab7a25bf06
  Operating System: Raspbian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)
            Kernel: Linux 5.10.63-v7l+
      Architecture: arm
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cat /etc/rpi-issue

```

## Toolchains
Using toolchains per [raspberrypi / tools](https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools):
```
sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf
sudo apt-get install g++-arm-linux-gnueabihf
sudo apt-get install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu
sudo apt-get install g++-aarch64-linux-gnu
```
Installed the former pair in case using a 32-bit Pi; installed the latter pair since RPi4 is 64 bit SoC, though need to check OS version

My installations ended up at:
- /bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc
- /bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc

## Cross-compile testing:
Tried this command: `fprime-util generate raspberrypi` in Ref/ and got error:
