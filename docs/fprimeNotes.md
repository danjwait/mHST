Get an error at [4.5.1. Set Up the Unit Test Environment](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/Tutorials/MathComponent/Tutorial.html#The-MathSender-Component_Write-and-Run-Unit-Tests_Set-Up-the-Unit-Test-Environment):

In discussion [here](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/discussions/1135#discussioncomment-2133443) pointed at [Fix Section 4.5.1 of Math Component Tutorial](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/pull/1243) ; had to look at the commit w/ the updated md, inlcuding finding related issue [fprime-util impl --ut command not generating Tester.cpp and Tester.hpp in Ref/MathSender](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/issues/1238) which included a note about removeing some files [here](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/issues/1238#issuecomment-1025790962). 
Finally ran into [Fatal error with fprime-util build --ut](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/issues/1258); wasn't obvious to me that the write up was to open Tester.hpp and change two instances of MathSenderComponentImpl to MathSender (had to go look at a related GitHub account [here](https://github.com/capsulecorplab/fprime/commit/5a815b4d6766edf7db385354688149462790c87d))


I find myself wanting a checklist / process flow diagram / overview. I am worried that after running the tutorials, I'll have to go back to the tutorials to remember the steps in order. Maybe the current checklist / flow diagram / overview can be expanded in the tutorials, with thinks like "fill in stubs" demoed?


Error at [5.2. Add the Model to the Project](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/Tutorials/MathComponent/Tutorial.html#The-MathReceiver-Component_Add-the-Model-to-the-Project). When trying to re-run [4.3. Build the Stub Implementation](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/Tutorials/MathComponent/Tutorial.html#The-MathSender-Component_Build-the-Stub-Implementation) got an error with `fprime-util impl` had to go up to /Ref/ and run `fprime-util generate` and then `fprime-util build` in /Ref, then cd back into MathReceiver to get `fprime-util impl` to work.

Error at [6.2. Updating the Topology](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/Tutorials/MathComponent/Tutorial.html#Updating-the-Ref-Deployment_Updating-the-Topology); first ran into this error:
```

Which looked like part of [fpp-check Resulting in Error Message #1255](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/issues/1255) ; per LeStarch suggestion, added `Ref/build-fprime-automatic-native/fpp-tools-install/` to $PATH. 

# Porting Math Demo to RPi
Started with [RPi demo instructions](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/Tutorials/GpsTutorial/Tutorial.html) but intent is to just cross compile the Math Component to the RPi first.

Using toolchains per [raspberrypi / tools](https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools):
`sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf` 
`sudo apt-get install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu`
Using the latter since RPi4 is 64
