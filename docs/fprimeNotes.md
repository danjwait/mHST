Get an error at [4.5.1. Set Up the Unit Test Environment](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/Tutorials/MathComponent/Tutorial.html#The-MathSender-Component_Write-and-Run-Unit-Tests_Set-Up-the-Unit-Test-Environment):

In discussion [here](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/discussions/1135#discussioncomment-2133443) pointed at [Fix Section 4.5.1 of Math Component Tutorial](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/pull/1243) ; had to look at the commit w/ the updated md, inlcuding finding related issue [fprime-util impl --ut command not generating Tester.cpp and Tester.hpp in Ref/MathSender](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/issues/1238) which included a note about removeing some files [here](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/issues/1238#issuecomment-1025790962). 
Finally ran into [Fatal error with fprime-util build --ut](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/issues/1258); wasn't obvious to me that the write up was to open Tester.hpp and change two instances of MathSenderComponentImpl to MathSender (had to go look at a related GitHub account [here](https://github.com/capsulecorplab/fprime/commit/5a815b4d6766edf7db385354688149462790c87d))


I find myself wanting a checklist / process flow diagram / overview. I am worried that after running the tutorials, I'll have to go back to the tutorials to remember the steps in order. Maybe the current checklist / flow diagram / overview can be expanded in the tutorials, with thinks like "fill in stubs" demoed?


Error at [5.2. Add the Model to the Project](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/Tutorials/MathComponent/Tutorial.html#The-MathReceiver-Component_Add-the-Model-to-the-Project). When trying to re-run [4.3. Build the Stub Implementation](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/Tutorials/MathComponent/Tutorial.html#The-MathSender-Component_Build-the-Stub-Implementation) got an error with `fprime-util impl` had to go up to /Ref/ and run `fprime-util generate` and then `fprime-util build` in /Ref, then cd back into MathReceiver to get `fprime-util impl` to work.

Error at [6.2. Updating the Topology](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/Tutorials/MathComponent/Tutorial.html#Updating-the-Ref-Deployment_Updating-the-Topology); first ran into this error:
```
~/02_Projects/fprime/Ref/Top$ fprime-util fpp-check -u unconnected.txt

Which looked like part of [fpp-check Resulting in Error Message #1255](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/issues/1255) ; per LeStarch suggestion, added `Ref/build-fprime-automatic-native/fpp-tools-install/` to $PATH. 

# Cross Compile Testing; Porting Math Demo to RPi
Started with the "Cross Compiling for the Raspberry PI" section of [F Fprime GPS demo instructions](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/Tutorials/GpsTutorial/Tutorial.html) but intent is to just cross compile the Math Component to the RPi first.

Tested the Math Component (per above) on WSL2 linux "native" first, then edited to cross compile.

Using toolchains per [raspberrypi / tools](https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools):
```
sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf
sudo apt-get install g++-arm-linux-gnueabihf
sudo apt-get install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu
sudo apt-get install g++-aarch64-linux-gnu
```
Installed the former pair in case using a 32-bit Pi; installed the latter pair since RPi4 is 64

My installations ended up at:
- /bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc
- /bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc

## Setup RPi4
Usual sudo apt-get update & upgrade
Followed RPi directions [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/remote-access.html) to setup SSH from host to RPi
Confirmed SSH ability from host to RPi4

## Cross-compile testing:
Tried this command: `fprime-util generate raspberrypi` in Ref/ and got error:
```

Tried setting up the complier by editing `/home/djwait/02_Projects/fprime/cmake/toolchain/raspberrypi.cmake` with line: `set(RPI_TOOLCHAIN "/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc")` and re-ran but ran into error with exisiting directory, so deleted the existing directory:
